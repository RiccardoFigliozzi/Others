## Intro

I just wanted to try to make a song with AI since I'm not a writer or something. 
I used this tools:

- ChatGPT - for the lyrics generation
- Mubert - for the beat generation
- Veed - for the edit of the audio 
- Voloco - for the autotune of my beautiful voice
- the colab notebook which is used to generate the video animation

My goal was to generate a song and a musci video in order to win the Sanremo festival 2023, but probably I'll win the next year since I was late for the candidatures.

It wasn't an easy task since I'm not a professional musician, composer or video editor and I can just play guitar and ukulele with the wish to learn one day.

## Lyrics generation with ChatGPT
First thing first, I used Chatgpt in order to generate some lyrics regarding a romatinc love pop song in italian.

## Beat generation

Then I needed to make a beat for the song and I used another ai generative tool Mubert to do this task.

## Adjusting the voice with some autotune

Actually here I just wanted to generate the voice too with another ai tool but I did'nt find anything that at now work as well as I wanted, so i recorded my voice and then i used an app to autotune it.

## Let's make a video

Finally I had everything to generate my video. What was to generate it with a colab notebook called Video killed the radio star, I put my lyrics and it generated me a video. Actually I wasn't satisfied with the result so I changed the input prompts from italian to english in order to have what I wanted in the video and this is the result:
