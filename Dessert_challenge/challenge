#In this challenge we want to predict if a recipe is a dessert based

#let's load the library that we need
library(tidyverse)

#and read the dataset that we have downloaded
recipes<- read_csv("dir/epi_r.csv")

#now we are going to clean the datasets from outliers and missing values
recipes<- recipes %>%
  filter(calories < 10000) %>% #this is for the outliers
  na.omit() #and this one is for NA values

#then we wnat to know if the ratings are all numerics
print("Is this variable numeric?")
is.numeric(recipes$rating)

#now let's check out if they are all integers
print("Is this variable integers?")
all.equal(recipes$rating, as.integer(recipes$rating)) == T 

#plot calories by whether or not it's a dessert
ggplot(recipes, aes(x =calories , y =dessert )) +
  geom_point()

#plot & add a regression line
ggplot(recipes, aes(x =calories , y =dessert )) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family = "binomial"))
