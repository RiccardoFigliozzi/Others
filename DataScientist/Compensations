# In this challenge we will try to fit a model to data following the assumptions
#So let's open libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(boot) # for diagnostic plot

#read in datasets
kaggle <- read_csv("dir/multipleChoiceResponses.csv")
stackOverflow <- read_csv("dir/survey_results_public.csv")

# just some data cleaning
has_compensation <- kaggle %>%
  filter(CompensationAmount > 0)%>%
  mutate(CleanedCompensationAmount = str_replace(CompensationAmount, "[[:punct:]]", ""))%>%
  mutate(CleanedCompensationAmount = as.numeric(CleanedCompensationAmount))
# the last two lines remove puncutation (some of the salaries has commas in them)
# and make sure that salary is numeric

# poisson model to predict salary by age
model <- glm(CleanedCompensationAmount ~ Age, data = has_compensation, family = poisson )

#let's use some diagnostic plots 
glm.diag.plots(model)

#remove salary above 150,000
has_compensation <- has_compensation %>%
  filter(CleanedCompensationAmount < 150000)

#then plot a linear model for salary rage
model <- glm(CleanedCompensationAmount ~ Age, data = has_compensation, family = poisson)

# and diagnotic plots
glm.diag.plots(model)

#finally plot and add a regression line
ggplot(has_compensation, aes(x = Age, y = CleanedCompensationAmount))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family = "poisson"))
